// Good news: the way Rust implements generic types means that
// your code wonâ€™t run any slower than if you had specified concrete types
// instead of generic types as parameters!

// Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of code using
// generic types at compile time.
// Monomorphization is the process of transforming generic code into
// specific code by replacing generic types with the concrete types that
// are actually used.

// What the compiler does is the opposite of the steps we took to
// create a generic type function.
// The compiler looks at all the places where the generic code is called
// and generates code for the concrete types that the generic code is called.
